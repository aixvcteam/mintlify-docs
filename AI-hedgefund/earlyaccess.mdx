Axelrod’s hedge fund service will launch with gated access as part of our phased rollout. This early access model is designed to reward long-term believers and active participants in the \$AXR ecosystem.

### Phase 1: High-Conviction Entry

To access Axelrod in Phase 1, users must hold or stake at least 500,000 \$AXR in a single wallet. 

Note: Aggregated balances across multiple wallets are not eligible during this phase.

### Why Gating?

This isn’t permanent. Token-gated access is a temporary mechanism to manage capacity and prioritize users who’ve demonstrated conviction. As Axelrod evolves and infrastructure scales, access will be progressively opened.

### Planned Rollout Tiers:

- **Phase 1**: ≥ 500k \$AXR
- **Phase 2**: ≥ 250k \$AXR
- **Future phases**: TBD

This structure allows us to refine performance, ensure user experience quality, and scale responsibly.

Stay tuned for updates on when new phases unlock.
