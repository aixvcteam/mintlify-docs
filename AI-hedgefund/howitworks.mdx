### Step 1: Check Access

To begin, users must connect a wallet that qualifies under the token-gated requirements. Eligible wallets should hold or stake the required amount of \$AXR (500k). Both Solana and EVM-compatible wallets are supported at this stage.

### Step 2: Complete Your Risk Fingerprint

After gaining access, users are prompted to complete a brief onboarding quiz. This quiz helps Axelrod determine your individual risk fingerprint—a profile that captures your risk tolerance, capital preferences, and investment behavior.

Users are classified into one of three risk categories:

- **Low Risk Investor**
- **Medium Risk Investor**
- **High Risk Investor**

This profile directly informs Axelrod’s trading logic, impacting strategy selection, position sizing, and trade types. For instance, a low-risk user may receive greater exposure to stable DeFi yield strategies, while high-risk users may see higher allocations to directional trading or emerging assets.

### Step 3: Deposit & Invest

Axelrod operates using USDC as the base currency. Users can deposit USDC from either the Solana or Base networks.

Once the deposit is confirmed, user will then "Invest" the amount they wish to allocate into Axelrod's Fund.  From there, Axelrod will begins allocating capital based on your risk fingerprint. Real-time execution is managed by a coordinated network of AI agents across strategies such as:

- Spot trading
- Perpetual contracts (Perps)
- DeFi yield optimization
