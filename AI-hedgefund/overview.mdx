One of the core service that Axelrod provides, designed to automate and optimize crypto capital allocation. Operating as an orchestrator, Axelrod analyzes user risk profiles, sources alpha from specialized agents, and executes strategy-driven trades across chains like Solana and Base.

Unlike traditional bots, Axelrod collaborates with a network of AI agents—spanning alpha signals, audits, and DeFi yield—using the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to adapt in real time. Users gain one-click exposure to a diversified portfolio of spot trades, perp strategies, and DeFi loops, all managed transparently and autonomously on-chain.
