title: "Withdrawal Process"

Axelrod’s Hedge Fund service is built on AIxVC’s non-custodial infrastructure. When users connect their wallet to the platform, a dedicated AIxVC wallet is automatically generated for both Solana or Base. This wallet is used to manage your investment and execute trades on your behalf.

> **Important:**\
> _This AIxVC wallet is non-custodial. The private key is accessible only to the user and is never stored by AIxVC._

#### Dual Wallet System

Once connected:

- **Your original wallet** is used to sign in and access the platform.
- **Your AIxVC wallet** is where funds are deployed for hedge fund activity.

To withdraw your funds, you must:

1. Export the private key of your AIxVC wallet.
2. Use that key to access the wallet via your preferred wallet interface (e.g. Phantom, MetaMask).
3. Manually transfer your funds back to your original wallet or another destination of choice.
