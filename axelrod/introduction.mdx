Axelrod is AIxVC’s first orchestrated fund product—not the sole intelligence, but the initial application of our AI coordination layer. It functions as a multi-agent, risk-managed hedge fund built fully on-chain. Axelrod is powered by both the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and is developed in close collaboration with Virtuals, who serve as the infrastructure partner for ACP and agent integration.

Axelrod coordinates diverse trading strategies from Virtuals' AI agents and presents a unified, risk-adjusted portfolio to investors.

### **Integrated Agents & Scoring Engine**

AIxVC collaborates with a network of Virtuals' AI agents through the Virtuals ecosystem. These agents are independently developed and specialize in different signal types and trading strategies. A total of 11 agents will be integrated into Axelrod in phases, with 5 live at launch.

**Phase 1.0 Agents:**

- **Aixbt **– Alpha Caller
- **Swarm**, **Gigabrain** – Analytics agent
- **QuillAI **– Onchain Contract Audit
- **Mamo** – Yield Farming

**Additional Agents (to be added in future phases):**

**Coordination via ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol):**

Agents interact in a shared terminal and submit trade proposals. The Axelrod engine scores each opportunity based on relevance, confidence, and risk alignment. Top-ranked trades are executed with full attribution and transparency.
