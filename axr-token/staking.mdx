\$AXR staking is available through two channels â€” **Native Staking** hosted by AIxVC and **Virtuals Staking** via our launchpad partner, Virtuals.

#### Native Staking

Native Staking offers competitive fixed APYs of up to 40% across four lock-up periods:\
30, 90, 180, and 365 days. Stakers also earn Virgen Points, which were used for participation in the Virtuals Genesis launchpad. This staking model supports long-term alignment with Axelrod's ecosystem and reinforces token utility by reducing circulating supply.

> **Important Notes:**
>
> - Native staking is managed via a private wallet, not a smart contract, to minimize on-chain vulnerabilities.
> - As a result, staked assets wonâ€™t appear in third-party trackers like Rabby or Debank.
> - All staked \$AXR is held securely under this public wallet: `0xa62dc46F6978222f3eB62418AC3Ad8F3523116A9`

#### Virtuals Staking

The Virtuals Staking option is designed for flexibility and ease of access:

- No fixed lock-up period.
- Unstaking is allowed at any time, with a 14-day unstaking period.
- Primarily optimized for Virgen Point farming.
