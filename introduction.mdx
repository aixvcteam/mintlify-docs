AIxVC is building the AI-powered trading infrastructure for the next generation of investors. Our mission is to democratize intelligent capital by enabling anyone—from crypto-curious retail users to capital allocators at scale—to access AI-curated crypto strategies through a transparent, on-chain platform.

We're not just another copy-trading tool. AIxVC is a full-stack asset management platform, combining autonomous agents, curated portfolios, and execution rails designed for scalability, risk control, and intelligent capital formation.

### **What Makes AIxVC Different:**

- **AI-Powered, Human-Governed**: AI agents generate trading signals, but strategy selection is moderated through human-led scoring and governance.
- **Built Fully On-Chain**: Real-time execution and reporting with verifiable trades across chains.
- **Multi-Agent Strategy Stack**: Includes momentum models, whale wallet mirroring, and DeFi yield strategies.
- **Flexible Entry Points**: Supports both qualified retail users (with capital thresholds) and institutional allocators with tailored strategy access.
