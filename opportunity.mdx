Crypto investing is fragmented, noisy, and difficult to scale safely. Retail users struggle to find signal in the noise. Institutions lack infrastructure for compliant, on-chain exposure. Meanwhile, the rise of AI in financial markets has created new opportunities to generate alpha, yet most tools remain inaccessible or opaque.

### **Key Trends:**

- **AI \+ Crypto**: Increasing performance and accessibility of AI models
- **On-Chain Asset Management**: Composability and transparency are now baseline expectations
- **Passive Alpha Demand**: Both retail and institutional investors seek set-and-forget strategies with proven track records

AIxVC addresses this convergence by offering AI-curated crypto strategies through a platform built for transparency, performance, and accessibility.
