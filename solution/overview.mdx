title: "The AIxVC Ecosystem"
---

#### AIxVC is structured around four core product lines:

### **1. AI Agent Copy-Trading _(Live)_**

Enables users to passively follow individual AI traders. Capital is allocated directly to a selected agent, with trades mirrored in real-time. This feature supports both on-chain execution and select centralized venues. These agents are not coordinated—each operates independently.

### **2. Axelrod AI Hedge Fund _(Beta Launching\!)_**

Axelrod is AIxVC’s flagship multi-agent hedge fund. It orchestrates third-party AI agents via the Virtuals Protocol's Agent Coordination Protocol (ACP) and Multi-Coordinator Protocol (MCP). Axelrod provides diversified, risk-scored portfolios and real-time attribution. Powered by the \$AXR token.

### **3. Smart Money / Whale Copy Trading _(Coming Soon)_**

Track and mirror high-performing wallets across multiple chains. This strategy layer relies on proprietary tracking tools and multi-chain analytics to capture alpha from capital-efficient, on-chain actors.

### **4. AIxVC Institutional Portfolio Management _(Coming Soon)_**

Tailored for family offices, high-net-worth individuals, and qualified retail investors with a minimum capital threshold. Portfolios are constructed and managed by AIxVC’s internal team, with AI support for signal validation, rebalancing, and strategy attribution.

All product lines operate under a unified execution and infrastructure layer. Axelrod is currently the only component that uses the AIxVC token (\$AXR) for access and governance. Other products may introduce independent access mechanisms or operate token-free.
